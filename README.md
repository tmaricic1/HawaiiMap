# Hawaii Heat Map Project

Welcome! This project aims to visualize which housing districts of Hawaii experience the most earthquakes and wildfires as a set of heatmaps. They are displayed on a react page that refreshes in 30 seconds intervals to account for new data. This data can be viewed in the Datasets folder.

2. `cd my-app` and then ``npm start` to run the react page
